# simple_pwd_cracker
This is the worlds slowest brute force password cracker.

It has a decent look in the terminal tho..

Maybe I'm gonna add some features like:
- Able to crack hashed passwords
- Able to use a password list first (i.e. SecList)
- Show Tries a second and time to exhaust all permutation for current password length
